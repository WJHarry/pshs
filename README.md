# pshs
Easy to search and apply history commands in Powershell.

The "history" command in PowerShell is session-level. pshs provides global-level history browsing and supports fuzzy search. Find your history and just "Enter" to execute it again.

This plugin is inspired by [hstr](https://github.com/dvorka/hstr)
